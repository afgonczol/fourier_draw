fourier_draw

The points.py file allows you to draw an image with a single stroke that should start and end near the same point.

The fourier.py file recreates this drawing using circles of different sizes that rotate at different frequencies.
The circle characteristics are calculated by using Fourier transforms.

It currently works, but is still very much a work in progress.
